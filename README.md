Up to x5 times faster than original Erlang/OTP in terms of network messaging.
The easiest way to create an OTP-designed application in Golang.

[https://ergo.services](https://ergo.services)

### Purpose ###

The goal of this project is to leverage Erlang/OTP experience with Golang performance. Ergo Framework implements [DIST protocol](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html), [ETF data format](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html) and [OTP design patterns](https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html) `gen.Server`, `gen.Supervisor`, `gen.Application` which makes you able to create distributed, high performance and reliable microservice solutions having native integration with Erlang infrastructure

### Features ###

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118860/113710255-c57d5500-96e3-11eb-9970-20f49008a990.png)

* Support Erlang 24 (including [Alias](https://blog.erlang.org/My-OTP-24-Highlights/#eep-53-process-aliases) and [Remote Spawn](https://blog.erlang.org/OTP-23-Highlights/#distributed-spawn-and-the-new-erpc-module) features)
* Spawn Erlang-like processes
* Register/unregister processes with simple atom
* `gen.Server` behavior support (with atomic state)
* `gen.Supervisor` behavior support with all known [restart strategies](https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html#restart-strategy) support
  * One For One
  * One For All
  * Rest For One
  * Simple One For One
* `gen.Application` behavior support with all known [starting types](https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html#application-start-types) support
  * Permanent
  * Temporary
  * Transient
* `gen.Stage` behavior support (originated from Elixir's [GenStage](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/GenStage.html)). This is abstraction built on top of `gen.Server` to provide a simple way to create a distributed Producer/Consumer architecture, while automatically managing the concept of backpressure. This implementation is fully compatible with Elixir's GenStage. Example is here [examples/genstage](examples/genstage) or just run `go run ./examples/genstage` to see it in action
* `gen.Saga` behavior support. It implements Saga design pattern - a sequence of transactions that updates each service state and publishes the result (or cancels the transaction or triggers the next transaction step). `gen.Saga` also provides a feature of interim results (can be used as transaction progress or as a part of pipeline processing), time deadline (to limit transaction lifespan), two-phase commit (to make distributed transaction atomic). Here is example [examples/gensaga](examples/gensaga).
* `gen.Raft` behavior support. It's improved implementation of [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io). The key improvement is using quorum under the hood to manage the leader election process and make the Raft cluster more reliable. This implementation supports quorums of 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 quorum members. Here is an example of this feature [examples/raft](examples/raft).
* Connect to (accept connection from) any Erlang/Elixir node within a cluster
* Making sync request `ServerProcess.Call`, async - `ServerProcess.Cast` or `Process.Send` in fashion of `gen_server:call`, `gen_server:cast`, `erlang:send` accordingly
* Monitor processes/nodes, local/remote
* Link processes local/remote
* RPC callbacks support
* [embedded EPMD](#epmd) (in order to get rid of erlang' dependencies)
* Unmarshalling terms into the struct using `etf.TermIntoStruct`, `etf.TermProplistIntoStruct` or to the string using `etf.TermToString`
* Custom marshaling/unmarshaling via `Marshal` and `Unmarshal` interfaces
* Encryption (TLS 1.3) support (including autogenerating self-signed certificates)
* Compression support (with customization of compression level and threshold). It can be configured for the node or a particular process.
* Proxy support with end-to-end encryption, includeing compression/fragmentation/linking/monitoring features.
* Tested and confirmed support Windows, Darwin (MacOS), Linux, FreeBSD.
* Zero dependencies. All features are implemented using the standard Golang library.

### Requirements ###

* Go 1.17.x and above

### Versioning ###

Golang introduced [v2 rule](https://go.dev/blog/v2-go-modules) a while ago to solve complicated dependency issues. We found this solution very controversial and there is still a lot of discussion around it. So, we decided to keep the old way for the versioning, but have to use the git tag with v1 as a major version (due to "v2 rule" restrictions). Since now we use git tag pattern 1.999.XYZ where X - major number, Y - minor, Z - patch version.

### Changelog ###

Here are the changes of latest release. For more details see the [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md)

#### [v2.1.0](https://github.com/ergo-services/ergo/releases/tag/v1.999.210) 2022-04-19 [tag version v1.999.210] ####

* Introduced **compression feature** support. Here are new methods and options to manage this feature:
  - `gen.Process`:
    - `SetCompression(enable bool)`, `Compression() bool`
    - `SetCompressionLevel(level int) bool`, `CompressionLevel() int`
    - `SetCompressionThreshold(threshold int) bool`, `CompressionThreshold() int` messages smaller than the threshold will be sent with no compression. The default compression threshold is 1024 bytes.
  - `node.Options`:
    - `Compression` these settings are used as defaults for the spawning processes
  - this feature will be ignored if the receiver is running on either the Erlang or Elixir node
* Introduced **proxy feature** support **with end-to-end encryption**.
  - `node.Node` new methods:
    - `AddProxyRoute(...)`, `RemoveProxyRoute(...)`
    - `ProxyRoute(...)`, `ProxyRoutes()`
    - `NodesIndirect()` returns list of connected nodes via proxy connection
  - `node.Options`:
    - `Proxy` for configuring proxy settings
  - includes support (over the proxy connection): compression, fragmentation, link/monitor process, monitor node
  - example [examples/proxy](examples/proxy).
  - this feature is not available for the Erlang/Elixir nodes
* Introduced **behavior `gen.Raft`**. It's improved implementation of [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io). The key improvement is using quorum under the hood to manage the leader election process and make the Raft cluster more reliable. This implementation supports quorums of 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 quorum members. Here is an example of this feature [examples/raft](examples/raft).
* Introduced **interfaces to customize network layer**
  - `Resolver` to replace EPMD routines with your solution (e.g., ZooKeeper or any other service registrar)
  - `Handshake` allows customizing authorization/authentication process
  - `Proto` provides the way to implement proprietary protocols (e.g., IoT area)
* Other new features:
  - `gen.Process` new methods:
    - `NodeUptime()`, `NodeName()`, `NodeStop()`
  - `gen.ServerProcess` new method:
    - `MessageCounter()` shows how many messages have been handled by the `gen.Server` callbacks
  - `gen.ProcessOptions` new option:
    - `ProcessFallback` allows forward messages to the fallback process if the process mailbox is full. Forwarded messages are wrapped into `gen.MessageFallback` struct. Related to issue #96.
  - `gen.SupervisorChildSpec` and `gen.ApplicationChildSpec` got option `gen.ProcessOptions` to customize options for the spawning child processes.
* Improved sending messages by etf.Pid or etf.Alias: methods `gen.Process.Send`, `gen.ServerProcess.Cast`, `gen.ServerProcess.Call` now return `node.ErrProcessIncarnation` if a message is sending to the remote process of the previous incarnation (remote node has been restarted). Making monitor on a remote process of the previous incarnation triggers sending `gen.MessageDown` with reason `incarnation`.
* Introduced type `gen.EnvKey` for the environment variables
* All spawned processes now have the `node.EnvKeyNode` variable to get access to the `node.Node` value.
* **Improved performance** of local messaging (**up to 8 times** for some cases)
* **Important** `node.Options` has changed. Make sure to adjust your code.
* Fixed issue #89 (incorrect handling of Call requests)
* Fixed issues #87, #88 and #93 (closing network socket)
* Fixed issue #96 (silently drops message if process mailbox is full)
* Updated minimal requirement of Golang version to 1.17 (go.mod)
* We still keep the rule **Zero Dependencies**


### Benchmarks ###

Here is simple EndToEnd test demonstrates performance of messaging subsystem

Hardware: workstation with AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X (64) @ 3.700GHz

```
❯❯❯❯ go test -bench=NodeParallel -run=XXX -benchtime=10s
goos: linux

### EPMD ###

*Ergo Framework* has embedded EPMD implementation in order to run your node without external epmd process needs. By default, it works as a client with erlang' epmd daemon or others ergo's nodes either.

The one thing that makes embedded EPMD different is the behavior of handling connection hangs - if ergo' node is running as an EPMD client and lost connection, it tries either to run its own embedded EPMD service or to restore the lost connection.

### Observer ###

It's a standard Erlang tool. Observer is a graphical tool for observing the characteristics of Erlang systems. The tool Observer displays system information, application supervisor trees, process information.

Here you can see this feature in action using one of the [examples](examples/):

![observer demo](.github/images/observer.gif)

### Examples ###

Code below is a simple implementation of gen.Server pattern [examples/simple](examples/simple)

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/ergo-services/ergo"
	"github.com/ergo-services/ergo/etf"
	"github.com/ergo-services/ergo/gen"
	"github.com/ergo-services/ergo/node"
)

// simple implementation of Server
type simple struct {
	gen.Server
}

func (s *simple) HandleInfo(process *gen.ServerProcess, message etf.Term) gen.ServerStatus {
	value := message.(int)
	fmt.Printf("HandleInfo: %#v \n", message)
	if value > 104 {
		return gen.ServerStatusStop
	}
	// sending message with delay
	process.SendAfter(process.Self(), value+1, time.Duration(1*time.Second))
	return gen.ServerStatusOK
}

func main() {
	// create a new node
	node, _ := ergo.StartNode("node@localhost", "cookies", node.Options{})

	// spawn a new process of gen.Server
	process, _ := node.Spawn("gs1", gen.ProcessOptions{}, &simple{})

	// send a message to itself
	process.Send(process.Self(), 100)

	// wait for the process termination.
	process.Wait()
	fmt.Println("exited")
	node.Stop()
}

```

here is output of this code

```shell
$ go run ./examples/simple
HandleInfo: 100
HandleInfo: 101
HandleInfo: 102
HandleInfo: 103
HandleInfo: 104
HandleInfo: 105
exited
```

See `examples/` for more details

* [gen.Supervisor](examples/supervisor)
* [gen.Server](examples/genserver)
* [gen.Stage](examples/genstage)
* [gen.Saga](examples/gensaga)
* [gen.Demo](examples/gendemo)
* [Node with TLS](examples/nodetls)
* [Node with HTTP server](examples/http)

### Elixir Phoenix Users ###

Users of the Elixir Phoenix framework might encounter timeouts when trying to connect a Phoenix node
to an ergo node. The reason is that, in addition to global_name_server and net_kernel,
Phoenix attempts to broadcast messages to the [pg2 PubSub handler](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.1.0/Phoenix.PubSub.PG2.html)

To work with Phoenix nodes, you must create and register a dedicated pg2 GenServer, and
spawn it inside your node. The spawning process must have "pg2" as a process name:

```golang
type Pg2GenServer struct {
    gen.Server
}

func main() {
    // ...
    pg2 := &Pg2GenServer{}
    node1, _ := ergo.StartNode("node1@localhost", "cookies", node.Options{})
    process, _ := node1.Spawn("pg2", gen.ProcessOptions{}, pg2, nil)
    // ...
}
```

### Development and debugging ###

There are options already defined that you might want to use

* `-ergo.trace` - enable extended debug info
* `-ergo.norecover` - disable panic catching
* `-ergo.warning` - enable/disable warnings (default: enable)

To enable Golang profiler just add `--tags debug` in your `go run` or `go build` like this:

```
go run --tags debug ./examples/genserver/demoGenServer.go
```

Now golang' profiler is available at `http://localhost:9009/debug/pprof`

To check test coverage:

```
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./...
go tool cover -html=cover.out -o coverage.html
```

To run tests with cleaned test cache:

```
go vet
go clean -testcache
go test -v ./...
```

To run benchmarks:

```
go test -bench=Node -run=X -benchmem
```
