## Reporting a bug or a feature request

Report bugs at https://github.com/ergo-services/ergo/issues

If you've found a **bug** or have a **feature request** then please create an issue in this repository (but search first in case a similar issue already exists).

## Submitting Pull Requests

You can contribute to Ergo Framework by opening a Pull Request. If you would like to fix a bug or 
implement a feature, please fork the repository and create a Pull Request. 

Before you start any Pull Request, it's recommended that you create an issue to discuss first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation.
That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s) agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge afterwards.
Also, let the maintainers know that you plan to work on a particular issue so that no one else starts any duplicate work.

In most cases, pull requests for new features should be based on the `master` branch.

Make sure that your feature does not break backward compatibility. In general, we only break backward
compatibility in major releases and only for a very good reason.

## Collaboration with maintainers

Sometimes the codebase can be a challenge to navigate, especially for a first-time contributor. We don't want you 
spending an hour trying to work out something that would take us only a minute to explain.
