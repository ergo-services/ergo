#### [1.2.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergo/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2021-04-07 ####

* Added TLS support. Introduced new option `TLSmode` in `ergo.NodeOptions` with the following values:
  - `ergo.TLSmodeDisabled` default value. encryption is disabled
  - `ergo.TLSmodeAuto` enables encryption with autogenerated and self-signed certificate
  - `ergo.TLSmodeStrict` enables encryption with specified server/client certificates and keys

  there is example of usage `examples/nodetls/tlsGenServer.go`
* Introduced [GenStage](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/GenStage.html) behavior implementation (originated from Elixir world).
  `GenStage` is an abstraction built on top of `GenServer` to provide a simple way to create a distributed Producer/Consumer architecture, while automatically managing the concept of backpressure. This implementation is fully compatible with Elixir's GenStage. Example here `examples/genstage` or just run it `go run ./examples/genstage` to see it in action
* Introduced new methods `AddStaticRoute`/`RemoveStaticRoute` for `Node`. This feature allows you to keep EPMD service behind a firewall.
* Introduced `SetTrapExit`/`TrapExit` methods for `Process` in order to control the trapping `gen.MessageExit` message (for the linked processes)
* Introduced `TermMapIntoStruct` and `TermProplistIntoStruct` functions. It should be easy now to transform `etf.Map` or `[]eft.ProplistElement` into the given struct. See documentation for the details.
* Improved DIST implementation in order to support KeepAlive messages and get rid of platform-dependent `syscall` usage
* Fixed `TermIntoStruct` function. There was a problem with `Tuple` value transforming into the given struct
* Fixed incorrect decoding atoms `true`, `false` into the booleans
* Fixed race condition and freeze of connection serving in corner case [#21](https://github.com/halturin/ergo/issues/21)
* Fixed problem with monitoring process by the registered name (local and remote)
* Fixed issue with termination linked processes
* Fixed platform-dependent issues. Now Ergo Framework has tested and confirmed support of Linux, MacOS, Windows.

#### [1.1.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergo/releases/tag/1.1.0) - 2020-04-23 ####

* Fragmentation support (which was introduced in Erlang/OTP 22)
* Completely rewritten network subsystem (DIST/ETF).
* Improved performance in terms of network messaging (outperforms original Erlang/OTP up to x5 times. See [Benchmarks](#benchmarks))

#### [1.0.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergo/releases/tag/1.0.0) - 2020-03-03 ####
## There is a bunch of changes we deliver with this release

* We have changed the name - Ergo (or Ergo Framework). GitHub's repo has been
renamed as well. We also created cloned repo `ergonode` to support users of
the old version of this project. So, its still available at
https://github.com/halturin/ergonode. But it's strongly recommend to use
the new one.
* Completely reworked (almost from scratch) architecture whole project
* Implemented linking process feature (in order to support Application/Supervisor behaviors)
* Reworked Monitor-feature. Now it has full-featured support with remote process/nodes
* Added multinode support
* Added experimental observer support
* Fixed incorrect ETF string encoding
* Improved ETF TermIntoStruct decoder
* Improved code structure and readability

#### [0.2.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergonode/releases/tag/0.2.0) - 2019-02-23 ####
* Now we make versioning releases
* Improve node creation. Now you can specify the listening port range. See 'Usage' for details
* Add embedded EPMD. Trying to start internal epmd service on starting ergonode.
