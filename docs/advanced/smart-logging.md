# Smart Logging

Basic logging - `log.Info("message")` - works for many scenarios. But production systems need more. Conditional logging that only activates for specific processes. Dynamic verbosity based on system load. Correlation across distributed processes. Logging that adapts to what's happening in the system.

This chapter covers techniques for making logging intelligent and adaptive rather than static and noisy.
