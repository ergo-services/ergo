# Applications

The additional application library for Ergo Framework contains packages with a narrow specialization or external dependencies since Ergo Framework adheres to the "zero dependencies" principle.&#x20;

You can find the source code of these applications in the application library repository at [https://github.com/ergo-services/application](https://github.com/ergo-services/application).
