# Network Protocols

The Ergo Framework allows nodes to run with various network stacks. You can replace the default network stack or add it as an additional stack. For more information, refer to the [Network Stack](../../networking/network-stack.md) section.&#x20;

This library contains implementations of network stacks that are not part of the standard Ergo Framework library.
